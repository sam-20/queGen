          1. The first thing to note is that our custom function should always
          return a final boolean output of TRUE or FALSE. In order to develop a
          function to achieve this, reframe your validation question. Eg.If the
          task is: "We want this column to accept only numbers" Reframed task
          becomes:"If we put the column value inside this function and the
          function returns TRUE, then it has passed the validation else failed
          if it returns FALSE."
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Produce the TRUE/FALSE answers of your custom function next to the
          target column. Eg. ColumnA(the target column) is what we want to
          validate, we therefore insert columnB next to it which gives the
          TRUE/FALSE answers of our validation function applied on ColumnA. The
          function for our task in this case would therefore be:
          {`=ISNUMBER(VALUE(A2))`}
          Also note that for our custom function we use the actual cell
          reference of the cell. Using an assigned name such as
          {`=ISNUMBER(VALUE([@Age]))`} would generate the TRUE/FALSE values
          correctly, however would produce an error when this name is finally
          pasted into the validation input box
        </p>
        <p>
          3. If you are getting the correct TRUE/FALSE values next to the target
          column, copy the function of only the first cell to the clipboard ie.
          {`=ISNUMBER(VALUE(A2))`}. So you'd notice that even though we want to
          validate an entire columnA, we might want our custom function to be
          something like {`=ISNUMBER(VALUE(A:A))`} However, this doesnt work and
          the correct function to use is the function of the first value inside
          columnB's TRUE/FALSE values which is {`=ISNUMBER(VALUE(A2))`}. Also
          remember we copy the function for B2 and not B1 because
          B1=columnheader
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Select the single column you want to validate(NB:!! SELECT WITHOUT

          5. Now you can delete the column used to generate the TRUE/FALSE
          values
        </p>

          6. Always remember that the custom formula you use for validation is
          the same formula you'd use to apply conditional formatting provided
          its the same column. In the end, the formula entered in the
          validation/conditional formatting input box should always return TRUE.
          The only difference is, one would apply formatting where TRUE, the
          other would give a pass validation when TRUE

    1. Passwords must be between 8 and 20 characters.

    3. Must contain one non-alpha character (a number or a symbol)`,
    ans: (
      <>
        <p>Breaking it down into stages</p>
        <p>
          1. Passwords must be between 8 and 20 characters:
          {`=AND(LEN(A1)>=8, LEN(A1)<=20)`}. A result of TRUE means it has
          passed the test
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Password must contain at least 1 lower & uppercase letter: At least
          1 uppercase means if all are lowercase then its wrong. Similarly, if
          all are uppercase then its wrong also. So we create an entire
          uppercase and lowercase version of the password If either one of them
          matches with the password, then it has violated the rule. ie.
          {`=NOT(OR(EXACT(A1,UPPER(A1)), EXACT(A1,LOWER(A1))))`}. A result of
          TRUE means it has passed the test
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Password must contain 1 non-alpha character (number or symbol):
          {`=IFERROR(SUMPRODUCT(AGGREGATE(15,6,FIND({"!","£","$","*","%","^","&"},A1),1)),0)>0`}
          The list of allowed symbols can also be placed into individual cells
          to form a range.Then placed in another worksheet which is protected
          and hidden. The function then becomes:
          {`=IFERROR(SUMPRODUCT(AGGREGATE(15,6,FIND('Allowed chars sheet'!$A$2:$A$8,A1),1)),0)>0`}
          A result of TRUE means it has passed the test.
        </p>

        <p>
          All these conditions should be TRUE therefore, our password validation
          formula becomes:
          {`=AND(AND(LEN(A1)>=8, LEN(A1)<=20), NOT(OR(EXACT(A1,UPPER(A1)), EXACT(A1,LOWER(A1)))), IFERROR(SUMPRODUCT(AGGREGATE(15,6,FIND({"!","£","$","*","%","^","&"},A1),1)),0)>0 )`}

        <p>
          1. In this example we created a formula that ensures the cell value
          contains only alphabets including upper and lower case alphabets as
          well as these 2 characters: %, 8
        </p>
        <p>
          2. We create a cell value to contains all the allowable characters. In
          this case we assign our allowable characters to cell A1. ie.
          {`A1 = ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz%8`}
        </p>
        <p>
          To check whether a cell's value eg. A2 meets the condition we use
          formula {`=AND(FIND(MID(A2,ROW(INDIRECT("1:"&LEN(A2))),1),A1))`}
          where A1 = allowed characters, A2 = cell being tested on
        </p>
        <p>The following results are produced</p>
        <p>TRUE - if A2 meets condition</p>
        <p>#VALUE - if A2 doesnt meet condition</p>

          NB!!: Unlike the custom formulas for validation and conditional
          formatting where the custom function takes a cell value in its formula
          eg.{`=ISNUMBER(VALUE(A2))`}, here in the filter function, the formula
          would take the entire column data being used rather than a single
          value ie. the column data without its headers. Check the examples for
          further clarification

        <p>
          Filtering when condition includes logical operators. NB:The logical
          operators: "AND,OR" are replaced by "*,+" respectively. Logical
          operators return TRUE/FALSE where TRUE = 1, FALSE = 0. This implies
        </p>
        <p>[TRUE] AND [TRUE] = TRUE is the same as 1 * 1 = 1</p>
        <p>[TRUE] AND [FALSE] = FALSE is the same as 1 * 0 = 0</p>
        <p>[FALSE] AND [FALSE] = FALSE is the same as 0 * 0 = 0</p>
        <p>[TRUE] OR [FALSE] = TRUE is the same as 1 + 0 = 1</p>
        <p>[FALSE] OR [FALSE] = FALSE is the same as 0 * 0 = 0</p>

        <p>Eg. Filter rows where name = "sam" and age {"<"} 20</p>
        <p>{`=FILTER(A2:D25,(A2:A25="sam")*(B2:B25<20))`}</p>

          {`=FILTER(A2:D25,((A2:A25="sam")+(A2:A25="abby"))*(B2:B25<20))`}.
          Don't forget to correctly include brackets when using nested logical
          operators
