    Ans2: I am Samuel Asare Botwe. And I’m a data analyst with over 4 years of experience and a master’s degree in Data Science and Analytics.
    My journey began back in Ghana with Kumasi Technical University, where I worked in the information department, managing the student database and conducting data collection and analysis.
    Then upon completion of my masters degree, I worked at Brunel University, where I analysed big data from GDELT news articles generated insights that informed decision-making.
    After that, I became a Junior Database Administrator at V-Land UK, optimizing SQL queries to enhance database performance.
    Currently, at Harrow Council, I work as a data analyst under the Supporting Families Programme where my role includes collecting and analysing data on families who are part of the programme. 
    Then using visualisations, I interprete my findings to senior management and discuss opportunities for improvement.
    But outside of work, I enjoy watching football and like to spend a lot of time with the family.

    que: `*****Can you run us through your work history*****`,
    ans: `
    After completing my undergraduate programme in 2019, I joined Kumasi Technical University for National Service Scheme programme.
    The NSS is a govt programme where Ghanaian students who graduate from accredited tertiary institutions are required under 
    law to do a one-year national service to the country.
    So during my time at KsTU, I worked across various departments with the aim of acquiring knowledge and skills in a wider range of areas. 
    In the first few months, I worked as web app developer. As part of developing web applications, I was also tasked with designing the database 
    for the applications and through that I started gaining some experience working with databases. 
    Then from there, I worked with the Database team by supporting them with the management of the school database through which
    I gained more experience on data manipulation using SQL. 
    My final year focused on data analysis, during which I assisted in collecting student data through surveys. 
    My duties included cleaning the data, analysing it, designing reports from the gathered data and communicating findings with senior management
    to improve student academic performance. So from the time working with databases through to analysing and reporting data, 
    I developed a very strong passion for working with data and decided to pursue a Masters’ Programme in Data Science and Analytics 
    in order to gain more knowledge and understanding of the field. 
    2 years (sep 2019 - aug 2021)

    Then in Brunel university, while working on my thesis, my supervisor referred me to the ceo of Edorer 
    whose project at the time aligned with my thesis. So I teamed up with them collected student data 
    through surveys and analysed to identify an effective adaptive learning approach. Then upon completion of my thesis,
    I was offered a role by the Brunel Talent Marketplace where I was tasked with performing sentiment analysis of data from GDELT.
    GDELT (Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone) is a huge database which stores news records of activities around the world.
    The data is available in Google BigQuery, and i was tasked with extracting and analysing this data to identify news trends and determine the tone.
    7 months (may 2022 - nov 2022)
    
    The work with Brunel was a short-term project so when my contract ended, I joined V-land UK as a database developer and manager.
    V-Land UK is news & media website covering all things vegan from food & drink to health & wellbeing
    V-land uk at the time was a startup company and my role involved developing and maintaining the database for their website application.
    I was in charge of writing queries to extract data from the database, normalising the data to eliminate redundancy in order to create more available
    space and also simplify the query processes. I also oversaw the creation of database backups to ensure that data can be recovered in the event of
    hardware or software failure, data corruption, malicious attacks or accidental deletion of data.
    While I enjoyed contributing to the team, New opportunities for professional growth and development and to use my skills and
    experience to make a meaningful impact within a larger community 
    8 months (dec 2022 - jul 2023)

    Now with my current role at Harrow Council, I work as a data analyst for the
    Supporting Families team. Supporting Families is a govt programme which focuses on building the
    resilience of vulnerable families by providing them the right support at
    the right time. Families are identified by problems such as unemployment, mental and physical health issues, financial instability.
    As a data analyst, my role includes collecting and analysing data on families who are part of the programme. 
    Then using visualisations and reports, I interprete my findings with senior management and discuss opportunities for improvement
    10 months (aug 2023 - sep 2024). I left my position as my contract came to a natural end and I am eager to explore new opportunities where i can apply and expand
    my skills in a more permanent role with greater growth potential

      Ans1: My most challenging project would come from the time i worked with vland as a junior database administrator. 
      So i was in charge of managing the database for the website application, and the website experienced performance issues. 
      As the website traffic increased, scaling became a major issue, leading to constraints which negatively impacted user experience. 
      Data loading on the site became significantly slower.
      To address these challenges, I conducted a thorough analysis of the database structure and query performance and noticed that the reason for the performance issue was due to 
      inefficent indexing and poorly optimized queries.
      So I implemented indexing strategies and optimized queries to improve efficiency.
      Then to efficiently manage the rise in traffic, we migrated to a more robust server setup and implemented load balancing.
      (Load balancing is the process of distributing traffic among multiple servers to improve a service or application's performance and reliability).
      Through these efforts, we significantly enhanced the website's performance and ensured it could scale effectively to meet growing user demands. 
      This experience taught me the importance of continuous monitoring and proactive optimization in managing databases.

      Ans2: My most challenging project I would say came during my tenure at Brunel University, where I analyzed GDELT timeseries news data. 
      The challenge lay in filtering through a vast amount of data to extract meaningful insights. 
      I utilized SQL for data extraction and Power BI for visualization, which required careful 
      attention to detail and analytical thinking. The project was successful, resulting in actionable 
      insights that informed strategic decisions, and it significantly enhanced my skills in handling complex datasets.

    you can do so politely: tell them why you can’t help, what you’re currently working on, and suggest a general time for when you’re free.
    •	However, if otherwise,
    •	What I do is to list down all the adhoc requests
    •	Then assess each ad hoc request in terms of the primary goal of the request, its timeline (whether it can be achieved realistically?), 
    complexity of the request, the urgency and whether others can be involved. 
    •	Start by evaluating deadline: Requests that must be completed within a very short timeframe (e.g., by the end of the day or within hours)
     should be prioritized highly before long term deadlines.
    •	Next is to assess urgency: Requests that are critical to business operations, affect multiple stakeholders, or have significant 
    consequences if not completed promptly should be given top priority over requests that can be postponed without major repercussions.
    •	Then consider available resources and If possible, assign some of the workload or requests to your team mates provided it doesn’t disrupt their schedule. 
    
    •	To prepare for future events, you can build time for ad hoc requests into your schedule
