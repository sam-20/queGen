    •	After completing my undergraduate programme in 2019, I joined Kumasi Technical University for National Service Scheme programme.
    The NSS is a govt programme where Ghanaian students who graduate from accredited tertiary institutions are required under 
    law to do a one-year national service to the country.
    So during my time at KsTU, I worked across various departments with the aim of acquiring knowledge and skills in a wider range of areas. 
    In the first few months, I worked as web app developer. As part of developing web applications, I was also tasked with designing the database 
    for the applications and through that I started gaining some experience working with databases. 
    Then from there, I worked with the Database team by supporting them with the management of the school database through which
    I gained more experience on data manipulation using SQL. 
    My final year focused on data analysis, during which I assisted in collecting student data through surveys. 
    My duties included cleaning the data, analysing it, designing reports from the gathered data and communicating findings with senior management
    to improve student academic performance. So from the time working with databases through to analysing and reporting data, 
    I developed a very strong passion for working with data and decided to pursue a Masters’ Programme in Data Science and Analytics 
    in order to gain more knowledge and understanding of the field. 
    2 years (sep 2019 - aug 2021)

    •	Then in Brunel university, while working on my thesis, my supervisor referred me to the ceo of Edorer 
    whose project at the time aligned with my thesis. So I teamed up with them collected student data 
    through surveys and analysed to identify an effective adaptive learning approach. Then upon completion of my thesis,
    I was offered a role by the Brunel Talent Marketplace where I was tasked with performing sentiment analysis of data from GDELT.
    GDELT (Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone) is a huge database which stores news records of activities around the world.
    The data is available in Google BigQuery, and i was tasked with extracting and analysing this data to identify news trends and determine the tone.
    7 months (may 2022 - nov 2022)
    
    •	The work with Brunel was a short-term project so when my contract ended, I joined V-land UK as a database developer and manager.
    V-land uk at the time was a startup company and my role involved developing and maintaining the database for their website application.
    I was in charge of writing queries to extract data from the database, normalising the data to eliminate redundancy in order to create more available
    space and also simplify the query processes. I also oversaw the creation of database backups to ensure that data can be recovered in the event of
    hardware or software failure, data corruption, malicious attacks or accidental deletion of data.
    While I enjoyed contributing to the team, New opportunities for professional growth and development and to use my skills and
     experience to make a meaningful impact within a larger community 
    8 months (dec 2022 - jul 2023)

    •	Now with my current role at Harrow Council, I work as a data analyst for the
    Supporting Families team. Supporting Families is a govt programme which focuses on building the
    resilience of vulnerable families by providing them the right support at
    the right time. Families are identified by problems such as unemployment, mental and physical health issues, financial instability.
    As a data analyst, my role includes collecting and analysing data on families who are part of the programme. 
    Then using visualisations and reports, I interprete my findings with senior management and discuss opportunities for improvement

    The READY programme is delivered in collaboration with UNHCR and aims to establish a sustainable lifestyle for a refugee settlement in Zambia.
    As part of the programme, students are grouped into teams and required to innovate a product or service to help solve problems faced by the people living in a Zambian refugee camp.
    Projects are conducted around areas such as Health and Disease Control, Water Supply and Sanitation, Energy Supply and Shelter

    que: `you and your team will be meeting the needs of several different customers, 
    all of whom may have differing priorities. If two customers were requesting urgent, 
    ad-hoc pieces of work from you, with similar deadlines, how would you deal with this?`,
    ans: `
    •	First and foremost the average worker should expect to be interrupted with requests 
    during work hours because the the requests can arise from a sudden change in schedule, or even tasks that were not scheduled to begin with.
    •	it’s important not to panic in times like this and also not throw away your current task because it may come with its own deadline as well.
    •	What I do is to list down all the adhoc requests
    •	Then assess each ad hoc request in terms of the primary goal of the request, its timeline (whether it can be achieved realistically?), 
    complexity of the request, the urgency and whether others can be involved. 
    •	Start by evaluating deadline: Requests that must be completed within a very short timeframe (e.g., by the end of the day or within hours)
     should be prioritized highly before long term deadlines.
    •	Next is to assess urgency: Requests that are critical to business operations, affect multiple stakeholders, or have significant 
    consequences if not completed promptly should be given top priority over requests that can be postponed without major repercussions.
    •	Then consider available resources and If possible, assign some of the workload or requests to your team mates provided it doesn’t disrupt their schedule. 
    •	Finally, it’s important to note that sometimes, you can’t do everything at once. If you need to turn a colleague down,
     you can do so politely: tell them why you can’t help, what you’re currently working on, and suggest a general time for when you’re free.
    •	To prepare for future events, you can build time for ad hoc requests into your schedule
